# VS Code
About this project:
This is my first project which I'm uploading on my github repository. This is the code of an ATM interface which uses basic modules including os and datetime. os module is used to give access and directly interact with the operating system to create account files automatically and hassle free. datetime module is used to stamp date and time of each transaction precisely. One can create accounts with your desired account number and pin with an initial depositing amounnt. The account number is used to create the file and the pin is used to login and access the features of the ATM. One can deposit, withdraw, transfer, check their current balance and their transaction history along with date and time stamp.

REQUIREMENTS:
>>> 4GB Ram and 256GB SSD for smooth and more optimised performance
>>> VS Code, Jupyter notebook, Pycharm or any other interpreter which supports python
>>> Python version: 3.8+

Thank you :)
